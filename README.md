## Features
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Includes univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to explore at least 20 features related to smoking behavior and cessation outcomes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Techniques such as normalization and outlier removal are applied to enhance model accuracy and performance.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Implementation of bagging, boosting, and Random Forests to improve predictive accuracy and robustness.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizes grid search and randomized search to fine-tune model parameters for optimal performance.
- **Visualizations**: Extensive use of libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to visualize data and analysis results.
- **Final Predictive Model**: A robust machine learning model capable of predicting smoking cessation success.
